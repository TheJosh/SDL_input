Group
	one or more
	multiple can be applied at a time
	e.g. player 1, player 2
	contains zero or more profiles
	has a user pointer (void *), passed in event structure
	do we need this? might be overkill, or easily implemented in user code
	just have profiles of p1_ground, p2_ground, p1_driving, p2_driving, etc
	
Profile
	one or more
	only one at a time
	can be changed to be a different profile per ???
	e.g. ground, driving, flying
	contains zero or more bindings
	has some extra settings too (e.g. sensitivity, accel, etc)
	has a user pointer (void *), passed in event structure
	
Binding
	connects a key, mouse axis or joystick axis
	can be analog or digital
	can bind to a handler or a float-pointer/bool-pointer or both
	has a user pointer (void *), passed in event structure
	e.g. "W" -> binary moveup, "S" -> binary movedown, "Mouse X" -> analog lookx
